  <h3 style="color:Orange">Halloween is on October 31. It is not a big holiday as there is still
  school and teachers still give out homework and even tests on this day. At night,
  people start going out for trick or treating. When trick or treating, you have
  to go in a costume. Each house they go to gives out free candy but if you do not have a 
  costume, they will not give you candy. But once people start growing up, it seems that they start
  losing intrest in trick or treating and start going to Halloween parties. These parties are
  basically regular parties but it is on halloween and people are dressed up in costume.</h3>
